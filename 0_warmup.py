# 1. Look at these websites first:
#
#    http://www.fly.faa.gov/flyfaa/usmap.jsp
#    http://services.faa.gov/docs/services/airport/


# 2. Write code to report weather information at various airports.
#
#    I have provided a Python module in this folder named "faa"
#    that contains a function that you will find helpful.
#
#    You must discover the name of the function and figure out
#    how to use it.
#
#    Your goal is to display some weather information
#    for each airport, like this:
#
#    ORD (Chicago): The temperature is 30.0 F (-1.1 C),
#    and the wind is Northeast at 8.1mph.
#
#    Good luck!

airport_codes = ['ORD', 'SFO', 'JFK', 'LGA', 'PHL', 'LAX', 'EWR', 'TEB', 'BOS']
